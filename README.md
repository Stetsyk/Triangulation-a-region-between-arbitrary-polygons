# Trinagulation-a-region-between-arbitrary-polygons
In this paper we propose the algorithm for triangulation of an area between arbitrary polygons on the plane with time complexity O(n log n). This algorithm consists of two steps: firstly, we reduce our problem to triangulation polygon with holes, and after that we use modification of monotone polygons methods. For first step we use Grahamâ€™s method to build convex hull. For second step we generalize method of monotone polygons for case when we have inner polygons. So, an efficient triangulation algorithm is received. The proposed algorithm is very simple for understanding and have a very simple implementation.
